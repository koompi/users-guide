# Package

Each Linux distribution uses a package management. Arch based uses Pacman package management that you can also use with Pionux. We highly recommend you to use our Pi package management.

For example:  
*   Debian: .dpkg (Debian Package Management)
*   Ubuntu: .apt (Advance Packaging Tool)
